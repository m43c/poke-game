# **PokéGame**: The adventure of catching Pokémon on your phone

**PokéGame** Developed for true fans of this fabulous franchise.

## Description
PokeGame is a mobile game developed with React Native and Expo SDK. It is primarily based on consuming PokeAPI to provide information about Pokémon.

The objective of the game is to catch the wild Pokémon found to complete the Pokédex. At the beginning, the player chooses their starter Pokémon to face in battles against wild Pokémon.

In battles, the player can select from the captured Pokémon and use them. There will be a section in the game to see all the captured Pokémon.

When a wild Pokémon is found, it can be attempted to capture. The game will notify if it is successful or if the Pokémon flees.
